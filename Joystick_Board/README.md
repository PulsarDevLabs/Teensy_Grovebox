## Overview
- This is a simple joystick board that takes standard ALPS joystick modules. (like the ones in PlayStation and Xbox controllers)
- The overall thickness of the Teensy Grovebox would be too thick if the joystick module was mounted on the main PCB. So the joystick board is a separate board that connects to the Teensy Grovebox PCB.
